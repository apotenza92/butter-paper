# Decisions

Product and process decisions that still hold. Replace an entry when the owner
changes it; history is in git.

## Product

- Butter Paper is the native Rust/GPUI app. The Electron app is frozen at
  `electron-final` and is a reference only. Startup imports no Electron data
  (`StartupDataPolicy::NativeOnly`). Electron 0.0.32 (tag `v0.0.32`) is the
  last Electron update: its migration installs native 0.1.3. The Electron
  update feed then lapses when its signed metadata expires.
- Bluebeam Revu is the reference: settle markup format and markup UX
  questions by matching what Revu does ([pdf-format.md](pdf-format.md)).
- Supported: macOS 13+ (Apple silicon and Intel), Windows x64 and arm64,
  Linux x64 and arm64. Butter Paper Beta is macOS only.
- Phone signing goes through the HTTPS signature relay
  (`services/signature-relay`), as Electron did, so the phone needs no route
  to the computer's network. The local-network (qrcp) helper is retired.
  Opening Signature starts a phone QR session straight away.

## Interface

- Use the stock gpui-component theme and standard control appearances as the
  UI baseline. Preserve the current application layout and control locations;
  review existing visual overrides rather than introducing a new theme.
- All three platforms retain an in-app menu bar with the shared command
  subset. The native macOS menu bar additionally exposes Mac-specific
  application and window commands; the in-app menu need not mirror it.
- Controls are stock gpui-component controls; the property toolkit in
  `property_controls.rs` composes them. Canvas, renderers, annotation layers
  and the scroll area are domain UI.
- Document tabs: stock Outline appearance; width follows the
  title up to 190px; the close button is hidden at rest and appears on hover
  or focus over the end of the title, which keeps its position and truncates.
  Open, New and template controls stay pinned right; an overflow menu appears
  only when tabs overflow.
- Recovery and save problems live in a conditional Recovery button beside
  Open/New, with a warning icon and item count. Its bounded, scrollable panel
  has a fixed top-right X; closing it never discards data. Recovery actions
  stay beside the affected document, including inactive documents. Ordinary
  unsaved edits use the tab asterisk and the close/save decision, not a banner
  or notification. Reviewing a historical warning explicitly clears it.
- New from template and Manage templates split list and preview 50/50.
- Transient panels and dialogs close with an icon-only top-right X inside the
  content; the word Cancel is reserved for a modal decision.
- Sidebars: page thumbnails on the left, properties on the right, both 300px
  by default and resizable; thumbnails hide automatically when the window is
  too narrow for both and return when it widens. The right tool rail snaps to
  whole columns.
- The viewer toolbar has zoom, fit and page-mode controls; CAD View was
  removed from it.

## Release

- `cargo xtask version X.Y.Z`, write the changelog section, commit and push
  `main`, then `cargo xtask release`. Releasing runs no tests: test while
  working; CI tests each push to `main` and each pull request separately.
- User-facing app names are Butter Paper (stable) and Butter Paper Beta
  (beta), without a version or architecture suffix on any platform.
- Releases are immutable and published once, complete, with checksums and an
  attested Homebrew bundle; never edit a release, ship a new version.
- PDFium is the approved chromium/7881 build, pinned by SHA-256 in
  `xtask/pdfium.json` and hosted on the `pdfium-7881` release.

## Blank document window

- The blank workspace shows up to 20 recently opened PDFs, newest first, with
  filenames and folder paths. Each file can be reopened or revealed separately
  in the system file manager; long paths truncate in the middle with the full path on hover.
- History is shared across windows and retained across launches. Only successful
  opens and saves enter it; generated blank/template sources enter after saving.
  Missing files use the normal opening error, rather than disappearing silently.
- On macOS, ⌘W closes the active tab; with no tabs, it closes the window.
